The pictures in `/exp/sorted_BOSS_NOUN_rs_100x100/` are from two sources:
  * The BOSS (Bank of Standardized stimuli) set, a normative high quality visual stimuli set developed for research purposes. [Their website is here.](https://sites.google.com/site/bosstimuli/home) Take a look at the paper as well:  
[Brodeur, M. B., Dionne-Dostie, E., Montreuil, T., & Lepage, M. (2010). The Bank of Standardized Stimuli (BOSS), a new set of 480 normative photos of objects to be used as visual stimuli in cognitive research. PloS one, 5(5), e10773.](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0010773)

  * The NOUN (Novel Object & Unusual Name) database that consists of novel object images, where the objects are complex, distinct entities. [Their website is here.](http://michaelhout.com/?page_id=759) More information can be found in the primary citation here:  
[Horst, J. S., & Hout, M. C.  (2015).  The Novel Object and Unusual Name (NOUN) Database: A collection of novel images for use in experimental research.  Behavior Research Methods, 48, 1393-1409. doi: 10.3758/s13428-015-0647-3.](https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/30612763.pdf)  
The NOUN database is freely available for anyone.

For the questionnaires following each task we rely on the great [MATLAB_PT_Questionnaire](https://github.com/Toshinaki/MATLAB_PTB_Questionnaire) tool:  
  * TOSHINAKI et al.. (2016). MATLAB_PTB_Questionnaire: 2016/08/06 first release. Zenodo. 10.5281/zenodo.59760
